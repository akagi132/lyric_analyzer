Hey ho, let's go―
They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The Kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop
Hey ho, let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go
